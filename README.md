## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains clinical indicators used to assess the risk of a heart attack in patients. 

Below is a description of each attribute:

| **Attribute**             | **Description** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Age**                  | Patientâ€™s age in years. Older individuals are generally at higher risk for cardiovascular issues. |
| **Gender**               | Binary indicator: <br>â€¢ 1 = Male <br>â€¢ 0 = Female <br> Gender is a relevant factor in heart disease, with risk profiles varying by sex and age. |
| **Heart rate**           | Heartbeats per minute. Abnormal heart rate can indicate cardiac stress or underlying issues. |
| **Systolic blood pressure** | Pressure in arteries during heartbeats. High systolic values are a significant risk factor for heart attacks. High values suggest hypertension.|
| **Diastolic blood pressure** | Pressure in arteries between heartbeats. Elevated diastolic pressure also contributes to cardiovascular risk. Also used to assess hypertension risk.|
| **Blood sugar**          | Blood glucose level (in mg/dL). Values above 120 mg/dL generally indicate hyperglycemia, a risk factor especially in diabetic patients. |
| **CK-MB**                | Creatine kinase-MB enzyme level, a cardiac biomarker. High levels can indicate heart muscle damage. |
| **Troponin**             | A protein released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Elevated levels are strongly associated with heart attacks. |
| **Result**               | Classification of the patient's condition: <br>â€¢ `positive` = Heart attack occurred <br>â€¢ `negative` = No heart attack detected <br> This is the target label for classification. |
| **Risk_Level**           | Categorical assessment of the patient's risk: <br>â€¢ Low <br>â€¢ Moderate <br>â€¢ High |
